# Python-Projects
 A place to store Python Projects I am working on
## Projects:
* [Phonebook](https://github.com/mdfull01/Python-Projects/tree/main/Phone_Book_Application)
* [File Transfer GUI](https://github.com/mdfull01/Python-Projects/tree/main/File_Transfer_App)

### Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries. 

### File Transfer GUI
This project allows the user to browse for source and destination directories for a file transfer. It evaluates which files have been created or modified in the past 24 hours and only transfers those files.
