### Phonebook
This project functions as a phone book for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a database and allows the user to update and delete previously stored entries. 

### File Transfer GUI
This project allows the user to browse for source and destination directories for a file transfer. It evaluates which files have been created or modified in the past 24 hours and only transfers those files. 

### Django Checkbook
This project is a web app that allows users to create accounts, enter transactions, and see the current balance of their account. 

### Nice or Mean Game
This project is a text based game that allows the user to choose how they will interact with several characters. Their choices will be scored and decide the outcome of the game.
